        <h1> Human Nature</h1>
        <p> 
            TouchDesigner, 2022
        </p>

        <p> Human Nature was a collaborative project where I was approached
            by a music-technology student to create visuals for an immersive audio-visual experience. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The visuals I created were to be controlled by T-sticks, an
            interactive instrument that was covered in different sensors which
            would interact with my visuals and the audio in real-time.
        </p>

        <p>
            We showcased the project at the Societe des arts technologiques inside
            the Satosphere; a massive 360 degree dome.
