            <p class="sub_p">TouchDesigner, Kinect, 2023</p>

            <p> Enter is a ineteractive art piece that I created for an event called Interface, which was a one night gallery event that centered around technology and our relationship with it.
            </p>

            <p>
                My idea behind the piece was to create a visualisation of how technology surrounds us and engulfs us in the modern world.
            </p>

            <p> As the user approaches the piece, the kinect sensor tracks their movement and as they move closer the pixels get brighter and start to surround the user, immersing them in this sea of glowing cubes.
